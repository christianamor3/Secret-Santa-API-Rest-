# SECRET SANTA API Rest
In this project, I have been working on creating a RESTful API for the popular Secret Santa game. The goal is to provide a fully custom solution for managing Secret Santa events digitally.
 
## Features: 
- **Data Persistence:** The API uses an H2 database to store and manage participant information securely. 
-  **RESTful Endpoints:** Various endpoints are implemented to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing participants, their preferences, and the Secret Santa assignments. 
- **HTML & CSS Frontend:** Alongside the API, I've experimented with frontend development using HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Secret Santa application. 
- **Game Logic:** The API includes algorithms to automate the process of assigning Secret Santas to participants while respecting any restrictions or preferences they may have. 
## Technologies Used: 
- **Spring Boot:** The API is built using the Spring Boot framework, providing easy setup and integration with other libraries. 
- **H2 Database:** For temporary data storage, H2 is used as an in-memory database, ensuring fast access and data consistency during Secret Santa events. 
- **Thymeleaf:** Thymeleaf templating engine is employed to dynamically generate HTML pages on the server-side, allowing for easy integration of backend data with frontend views. 
- **HTML & CSS:** Basic HTML and CSS are utilized to create a simple yet effective user interface for managing Secret Santa events. 

## Future Enhancements: 

- **Email Notifications:** Integrating email notifications to inform participants of their Secret Santa assignments and any important updates. 
- **Improved Frontend:** There is a problem with the CSS while running the SpringBoot application, so I will try to solve that. Enhancing the frontend design and user experience with more interactive features and responsive layouts.
